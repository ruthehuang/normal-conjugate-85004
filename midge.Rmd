We will work on this together in class today.

Here is the midge data:

```{r midegeData}
  y <- c(1.64, 1.70, 1.72, 1.74, 1.82, 1.82, 1.82, 1.90, 2.08)
```

1. Using a conjugate prior for the variance, use the Monte Carlo method to approximate the joint distribution for the mean and variance.


2. Plot $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots, \y_n$. Show a 95% quantile-based interval for the posterior mean

3. Plot the joint posterior distribution of $\theta$ and $\sigma$.
