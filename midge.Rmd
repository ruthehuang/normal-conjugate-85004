We will work on this together in class today.

Here is the midge data:

```{r midegeData}
  y <- c(1.64, 1.70, 1.72, 1.74, 1.82, 1.82, 1.82, 1.90, 2.08)
```

Using a semiconjugate prior for the variance, use the Monte Carlo method to
approximate the joint distribution for the mean and variance. Compare a 95%
quantile-based interval for the posterior mean to a 95% frequentist confidence
interval.
